UCky-elRIu-ueh5RV3xmPeqw,ITTIA,"ITTIA's next generation embedded database technology, ITTIA DB SQL, delivers capabilities culminated from decades of database evolution in a compact, self-managing package for MPUs. It is used in applications such as medical devices, industrial automation, portable data terminals, consumer electronics, network appliances, and automotive systems. It has enabled manufacturers to leverage enterprise data management features on embedded systems and IoT edge devices across product lines with desired operating systems and hardware.

ITTIA DB IoT for MCUs is a time series embedded database for data processing and data management on devices running real time operating systems (RTOS). This database technology is suitable for device applications that require fast response to process data, such as events and alarms, that both push and pull updates. ITTIA DB IoT offers developers to benefit from their existing database familiarity with traditional database systems.
